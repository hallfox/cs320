Interestingly most of these models are just slightly off of the given output, usually within a margin of error of 100 misses (both above and below). This is especially striking because the only model that's dead on accurate is the DirectCache, which is just a special case of the more general Cache which uses a set associative model. I must be doing something that's slightly out of order or something, leading to slightly different results. Pls don't burn me too bad. I hope the code reads nice at least.
